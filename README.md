# semantic-segmentation-project
This repository contains the source code and documentation for my master's project titled "Semantic Segmentation of Drone Imagery Using Deep Learning".

<br>


The project focuses on employing a deep learning-based approach for accurate and efficient semantic segmentation of objects in drone imagery. The repository includes implementation of deep learning architectures, such as U-Net, as well as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation scripts.

# Dataset
- The Semantic Drone Dataset focuses on semantic understanding of urban scenes for increasing the safety of autonomous drone flight and landing procedures. The imagery depicts  more than 20 houses from nadir (bird's eye) view acquired at an altitude of 5 to 30 meters above ground. A high resolution camera was used to acquire images at a size of 6000x4000px (24Mpx). The training set contains 400 publicly available images and the test set is made up of 200 private images.
- The complexity of the dataset is limited to 20 classes as listed in the following table. 
- The dataset can be downloaded from [ICD-DroneDataset](http://dronedataset.icg.tugraz.at/)
