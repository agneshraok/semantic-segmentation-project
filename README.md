# semantic-segmentation-project
This repository contains the source code and documentation for my master's project titled "Semantic Segmentation of Drone Imagery Using Deep Learning".

<br>


The project focuses on employing a deep learning-based approach for accurate and efficient semantic segmentation of objects in drone imagery. The repository includes implementation of deep learning architectures, such as U-Net, as well as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation scripts.
